Put your resume PDF file here:

## Steps to Add Your Resume

### 1. Create/Export Your Resume as PDF
- Use Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Canva
- Export/Save as PDF format
- Make sure it's professional and up-to-date

### 2. Rename the File
- Name it exactly: `resume.pdf` (lowercase, no spaces)

### 3. Place in Assets Folder
- Copy your `resume.pdf` file
- Paste it in: `C:\Users\JM\Documents\jules_portfolio\assets\`
- NOT in the `images` folder - directly in `assets` folder

## File Structure

Your `assets` folder should look like this:

```
assets/
├── images/
│   ├── profile.jpg
│   ├── lspu-logo.png
│   └── (project images...)
└── resume.pdf          ← PUT YOUR RESUME HERE
```
